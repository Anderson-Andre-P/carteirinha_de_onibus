# Virtual Card System Database

This database project was created with the aim of helping a transportation company to implement a virtual card system for students to use public transportation free of charge. The project covers all aspects of database management, including the design of the database schema, data normalization, data population, and the implementation of complex queries, stored procedures, views, and user management.

The first step in the project was to design a database schema that would be optimal for storing the necessary information about the students, the transportation routes, and the transactions made with the virtual card system. To ensure data integrity and minimize data redundancy, the schema was designed to be normalized up to the third normal form.

After the schema design was complete, the next step was to populate the database with sample data. This data included information about the students, such as their names, addresses, and contact information, as well as information about the transportation routes, such as the starting and ending points, the distance, and the duration of the trip.

Once the data was populated, a series of queries were developed to retrieve and analyze the data. These included simple queries such as selecting all students' names and addresses, as well as more complex queries such as nested queries, conditional expressions, and regular expressions to analyze the transactions made with the virtual card system.

To further optimize the database performance, several stored procedures were developed. These procedures automated common tasks such as adding new students, updating transportation routes, and calculating the fare for a given trip.

Views were also created to provide a more user-friendly interface for the data. These views allowed the users to easily access and manipulate data without needing to write SQL queries.

Finally, user management was implemented to ensure data security and integrity. Several user accounts were created with varying levels of access to the database to limit access to sensitive data and prevent unauthorized changes to the database.

Overall, this project provides a comprehensive example of database management for a transportation company implementing a virtual card system. The project covers all aspects of database design, implementation, and management, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in database management.
